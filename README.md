# My Third Data Science Project

## Analyzing Used Car Listings on eBay Kleinanzeigen

In this project, we will be working with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, which is the classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. The version of the dataset we will be working with is a sample of 50,000 data points. It has been prepared by Dataquest, including a simulation of a less-cleaned version of the data.
